# NAPS2 (Not Another PDF Scanner 2)

This fork NAPS2 lets sending PDF document to Lotus Notes with only a couple clicks.
Added button "Send to LN"
The "Send to LN" button allows you to attach a scanned PDF file to a previously opened Lotus Notes document with one click. Requires installed Lotus Notes client.
